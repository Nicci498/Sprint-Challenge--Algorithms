#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear time O(n) - as the input 'n' gets larger, the output grows in direct proprtion. If n = 2, a eqauls 4 and then 8 before the while loop ends, n = 5 a equals


b) O(n log n))-inside of one O(n) loop lies another loop that increases at half the rate of the input. Input f 2 gives us 2 elements, input of 20 gives us 100


c) Linear - O(n) - We keep looping until we run out of bunnies so our bunny ear counting functions outputs in direct coorelation to the input size

## Exercise II

O(log n) - I would use a bianary search method by find the mid point of the ground floor anf floor f, then i would drop one egg, if it broke, id know i needed a lower level, if not, a higher level, i would then find the mid point between the floor i dropped from and either the ground or top floor depending on the egg breakage, and repeat
